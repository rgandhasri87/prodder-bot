# About

This Discord bot started as a bot to constantly remind me to think about whether what I'm doing is worth the time I am spending on it. I was inspired to make this from taking a philosophy class at university where it was discussed how one can become virtuous by asking "What would a virtuous person do?" even if they don't necessarily know what virtue (in the Ancient Greek context) is.    

Also, this project was meant as a way for me to finally start learning how to use Node.js and TypeScript.

# Setup
TBA

# Features

* Every now and then (interval to be decided) the bot will send a DM asking whether you are happy with what you are doing. (Hence the name, prodder bot)
    * I could expand on this to have the user react yes/no and the bot keeps track of this.
    * If you are not happy, the bot will give you a task to do.
* At a time selected by the user, the bot will DM asking you to tell it your tasks for the day. If the time is during the night, it will have you outline the next day's tasks.

# Possible Names

The working name for this bot is **prodder_bot**.
Other names that might be cool would be:
* Unzymandias
    * The original Ozymandias poem has themes of death, decay, impermanence, etc. I would like to think this bot helps stave those off, especially decay.
* Entrophus
    * Entropy + Sisyphus
* Unmemento
    * Kind of pun on Memento Mori
* Samsara
    * because tasks are always there. They are born, live, and die, and some chronically recur
